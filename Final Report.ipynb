    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people like my friends, Adam and Eve and their 5-yr old, in exploring better facilities in West Vancouver. It will help them making smart and efficient decision on selecting the most suitable neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in West Vancouver, BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people are migrating to West Vancouver in Greater Vancouver region of Canada and need lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aims to create an analysis of features for anybody migrating to West Vancouver to search a suitable neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to West Vancouver for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Extraction & Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used  West Vancouver dataset which was scrapped from wikipedia. Dataset consisting of latitude and longitude, zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I've extracted the attributes 'Postalcode','Borough' and 'Neighborhood' Dataset. It was then then cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foursquare API Data\n",
    "    \n",
    "I need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information I use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, I then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, I have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neighborhood\n",
    "2. Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "3. Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "4. Venue\n",
    "5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n",
    "6. Venue Latitude\n",
    "7. Venue Longitude\n",
    "8. Venue Category\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map of West Vancouver\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Map_of_West_Vancouver.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Geograpical Co-ordinate of Neighborhoods w.r.t address West Vancouver, BC were determined. I then fetched the nearby locations in tabular form followed by categories fetching. Some of the fetched categories include Clothing Store,Restaurant,Coffee Shop,Intersection,Sandwich Place,Gas Station,,department Store etc. This project fetched 16 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Category encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "I first encoded the categories using one hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Clustering Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to explore neighborhoods, I need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Using K-Means Clustering Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I applied K-Means clustering method with value of k=10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Map of Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "I used folium library of python to determine the map of clusters with k-clusters value of 10\n",
    "![](Clusters.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Average Housing Price by Clusters in West Vancouver\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained following average housing price for West Vancouver\n",
    "![](Avg_housing_price.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 4.3 School Ratings by Clusters in West Vancouver\n",
    "![](School_ratings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 The Location\n",
    "\n",
    "West Vancouver is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of on the rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.5 Foursquare API\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Discussion Section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Which Tried to Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in West Vancouver for the person who are to live there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby. Especially,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion Section\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, by using k-means cluster algorithm we were able to separate the neighborhood into 3 different clusters, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average house prices and school rating have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can be used as an application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "West Vancouver South neighborhood offers the best elementary school opportunities, however, its average housing price is also the highest in West Vancouver. West Vancouver North neighborhood offers the 2nd best elementary schools, however, its average housing price is 22% lower than that of West Vancouver South. So I would like to recommend West Vancouver North to Adam and his family. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can be continued for making it more precise in terms to find best house in West Vancouver. Best means on the basis of all required things(daily needs or things we need to live a better life) around and also in terms of cost effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
