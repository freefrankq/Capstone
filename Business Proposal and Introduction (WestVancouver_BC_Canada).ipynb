    "### Problems Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby. Especially, 2 tasks to be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Location \n",

    "## Foursquare API\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",

    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
